A/B Testing (with randomized experiment)
https://google.github.io/abpackage/abpackage.html
- The abpackage R package implements PrePost, a Bayesian approach for the estimation of the treatment effect in A/B testing. When pre-period data are available, the method leverages the pre-period to get a more accurate estimate of the treatment effect.

Causal Inference with Treatment Group (not A/B)
https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html
- This R package implements an approach to estimating the causal effect of a designed intervention on a time series. For example, how many additional daily clicks were generated by an advertising campaign? Answering a question like this can be difficult when a randomized experiment is not available.
